"Data refer to resident employed households. A resident employed household refers to a household headed by a resident (i.e. Singapore citizen or permanent resident) and with at least one working person. Household income from work refers to the sum of income received by working members of the household from employment and business.  However, it does not include the income of maids. Household income from work includes employer Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions.  Monthly household income from work includes one-twelfth of annual bonus.  Data on household income from work refers to household income from work before accounting for Government transfers and taxes, unless stated otherwise.  The dollar values are in nominal terms. More data and analyses on household income from work can be found in the paper 'Key Household Income Trends, 2019'.  The paper can be accessed via the following web-link: www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/households/household-income/publications-and-methodology"

REAL CHANGE IN MONTHLY HOUSEHOLD INCOME FROM WORK PER HOUSEHOLD MEMBER (INCLUDING EMPLOYER CPF CONTRIBUTIONS) AT 20TH PERCENTILE - THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX (CPI) IS USED AS THE DEFLATOR TO COMPUTE REAL INCOME CHANGES.

"    1ST DECILE - THE DECILES ARE DERIVED BASED ON THE RANKING OF RESIDENT EMPLOYED HOUSEHOLDS BY THEIR MONTHLY HOUSEHOLD INCOME FROM WORK PER HOUSEHOLD MEMBER (INCLUDING EMPLOYER CPF CONTRIBUTIONS).  IT IS NOTABLE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT SOME RESIDENT EMPLOYED HOUSEHOLDS IN THE LOWEST 10% OWNED A CAR (14.5%), EMPLOYED A MAID (12.7%), LIVED IN PRIVATE PROPERTY (7.1%) OR WERE HEADED BY PERSONS AGED 65 YEARS AND OVER (29.9%) IN 2019.  IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE THAT NOT ALL HOUSEHOLDS ARE CONSISTENTLY IN THE SAME DECILE GROUP FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT.

"GINI COEFFICIENT BASED ON EQUIVALISED HOUSEHOLD INCOME FROM WORK (INCLUDING EMPLOYER CPF CONTRIBUTIONS) AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR GOVERNMENT TRANSFERS AND TAXES (BASED ON SQUARE ROOT SCALE) - INTERNATIONALLY, THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN COMPUTATION METHODS ADOPTED BY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, ALTHOUGH THE BASIC CONCEPT OF GINI REMAINS THE SAME.  ONE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS IN THE EQUIVALENCE SCALE ADOPTED.  EQUIVALENCE SCALES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ECONOMIES OF SCALE WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD, AND ADJUST FOR HOUSEHOLD SIZE SO THAT HOUSEHOLDS WITH DIFFERENT SIZES AND COMPOSITIONS ARE COMPARABLE.  THERE ARE DIFFERENT SCALES USED BY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS.  BASED ON THE SQUARE ROOT SCALE, INDIVIDUALS ARE RANKED BY THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME ON A PER EQUIVALISED MEMBER BASIS', WHICH IS DERIVED BY DIVIDING HOUSEHOLD INCOME BY THE SQUARE ROOT OF HOUSEHOLD SIZE.  THIS FOLLOWS THE APPROACH ADOPTED BY ORGANISATION OF ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) IN SOME REPORTS.  IN FOLLOWING THIS APPROACH, INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS CHILDREN AND MAIDS WOULD ALSO BE RANKED.  IT IS ALSO NOTED THAT SOME OECD COUNTRIES PUBLISH THEIR OWN GINI USING A DIFFERENT EQUIVALENCE SCALE, AND NOT THE SQUARE ROOT SCALE.  DATA ON INCOME AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR GOVERNMENT TRANSFERS AND TAXES FOR 2019 ARE PRELIMINARY.  SIMILAR TO PAST PRACTICES, AS MORE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA ON GOVERNMENT TRANSFERS OR TAXES BECOME AVAILABLE, THE COVERAGE HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MORE TYPES OF TRANSFERS."
