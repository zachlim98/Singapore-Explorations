"Total population comprises residents and non residents.  Residents comprise Singapore citizens and permanent residents.  Data is based on mid-year Labour Force Survey except Census years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and General Household Surveys 1995 & 2005.  Data exclude construction workers living at worksites and workers who commute daily from abroad to work in Singapore, except for Census years and General Household Survey 2005.  To facilitate comparison with 2008, 2007 Labour Force Survey data have been adjusted based on Singapore Department of Statistics' revised population estimates (released in February 2008) which exclude Singapore residents who have been away from Singapore for a continuous period of 12 months or longer."
