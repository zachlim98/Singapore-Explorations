# Singapore Datasets
## Introduction

Not many Singaporeans know but many datasets are publicly available on data.gov.sg 

These offer an interesting peek into certain aspects of Singapore life that can perhaps be understood better by data. Join me as I trawl through these datasets to find interesting perspectives

## Covid-Viz

This was a project to build a better visualisation than Strait Time's graphics of Covid cases in Southeast Asia. I cleaned up the data that was downloaded from ourworldindata.org and then plotted it in R (because I was going through a crisis at the time and needed the sweet sweet comfort of R)

## Environment

Various datasets with regards to the environment. I've been wanting to simulate future temperature changes based on past records but still working on that right now because of a lack of historical data. 

## HDB Ballot

A (mostly failed) project to simulate how HDB does balloting for BTO. A huge lack of historical information from the government so that's being left for now

## PM Lee Speech Analysis

A sentiment analysis exploration that looked at the sentiments in his Covid-19 speeches! Reddit thread can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/kgr489/i_analysed_pm_lees_covid19_speeches_and_this_is_a/). 

## Suicide Rate

One of my first explorations to try to understand Singapore's increasing suicide rate using data. Again, there just wasn't even fine-level data available which resulted in there being no conclusive results. Write-up about this can be found [here](zachlim98.github.io/me).
